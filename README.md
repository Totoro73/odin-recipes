learning outcomes (11/29/23):
    I am designing a basic website that will display my new understanding of html foundations. The website will be a place to find a number of food/drink recipes. I imagine a home page that describes a chef's mission, and/or a common theme that ties the various recipes together. This home page will hold links to each recipe, where the user will be able to access lists of ingredients needed, instructions on how to execute the recipes, and inclued attached pictures that will guide and inspire the user to complete the recipes.
