    <p>Three holiday drinks to get your Christmas cheer on; these drinks are meant to be enjoyed as a set, for a holiday evening special: a bubbly poinsettia as a cool and crispy starter, a warm and full-bodied old-fashioned Swedish glogg for a deep winter lounge beside a meal, and a cozy and caffeinated eggnog latte topped with whip cream and nutmeg to really feel the warmth of the holiday spirit. Merry Christmas!!! I hope you enjoy this set of holiday drinks as much as I do! </p>
